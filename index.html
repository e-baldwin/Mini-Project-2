                        Data Selection: We chose the global COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle because it is a pandemic that has affected the lives of many around the world during this time. As a result, we wanted our project to have a practical application by illustrating the deadly results the pandemic has had, and whether there were any trends or significant correlation between a country's GDP, vaccination status, and age groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before creating any visualizations with the dataset, we first had to determine which countries had no values for specific categories that we were analyzing. With these countries having NULL values, we opted to discard them to create a whole and complete dataset. Additionally, some of the data was mislabeled or incorrect. For instance, the total cases for 'North America' as a whole had been placed under the total cases per country.

                        To express the total cases/total cases per million, we elected to use a treemap with the area representing the total cases and the shade of tcolor representing total cases per million. As expected, more populous countries yielded a greater number of cases, but that was not necessarily the case with cases per million.

                        In the same way, a treemap was also used to depict the total deaths/total deaths per million.

                    <p>
                        Now that the vaccines have been approved for months, we thought it would be interesting to look at the percentage of vaccinated individuals. 
                        We displayed the data using a stacked bar chart for each country to compare the different parts of the population. 
                        It is sorted in descending order, by the number of people that have gotten at least one vaccine. 
                        The dark blue bar represents the number people that are fully vaccinated while the light blue bar represents the number of people that have gotten one vaccine. 
                        The orange bar represents the number of people that are completed unvaccinated. 
                        Countries with a higher population tended to have more people that were vaccinated. 
                        We still had more questions after this, so we continued the discussion in our next visualization. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After that, we wondered how vaccination rates affected the positivity rate. 
                        If more people were vaccinated, then surely the number of people getting infected with COVID-19 would surely decrease. 
                        We used a scatterplot to illustrate this problem. 
                        It compares the percent of people vacinnated with the positivity rate, and each country is represented by a point. 
                        The color of each point represents the continent of the country, while the size represents the population density. 
                        Overall, the positivity rate and percent of the population vaccinated seem to have no correlation. 
                        Something to note was that countries that tended to have a larger population density also tended to have a higher percentage of their population vaccinated. 
                        This is likely because countries with larger populations tend to have higher GDP per capita as well, to support that population. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, we compared the positivity rate with the GDP per capita. 
                        As you can see, there is a slight correlation, although many of the data points are gathered on the y-axis. 
                        The countries at the top, with higher GDP per capita tended to have a lower positivity rate than some countries with lower GDP per capita. 
                        This holds true for many countries, but we must also note that there are a lot of country data points gathered around the origin.

                        Question 3: 
                        <p>It is known that the Corona Virus is more dangerous to older people and older populations. </p>
                        <p>We displayed this data using side by side bar graphs in order to compare populations with people aged 65 and older with Covid-19 deaths.
                            It can be seen that older populations tend to have higher death rates, however it is not as closely related as expected. We continue this discussion by using the median age of populations. We wanted to know that if a population had a higher median age, then they would also have a higher covid death rate. 
                            We used multiple bar charts to compare this data.</p> 
                            <p>We can see in this second graph that the covid-19 death rate is not correlated at all with an increased median age. This seems surprising.
                        However, we decided to compare GDP with median age as well. GDP tends to increase with median age. We can understand that populations with older populations are more likely to have a higher GDP per capita. This is because countries with higher GDPs are more likely to have more health care related resources.
                        This would allow them to support an older population along with supporting their population throughout the corona virus pandemic.</p>
                        <p>The third chart is a bubble chart. The size of the bubbles correspond to the total deaths per million while the color of the bubble corresponds to the GDP per capita.
                            We chose to use a bubble chart with varying colors and sizes in order to show that the larger bubbles are more likely to have lighter colors. This means that the lower the GDP per capita the more likely it is that the total death rates per million are higher.
                            <p>
                                We can see that our initial hypothesis based on age and death rates was incorrect. 
                                The median age of a country does not relate to the total death rate per million of each country. The GDP per capita explains this. It also can be seen that countries with higher GDPs per capita have lower death rates.
